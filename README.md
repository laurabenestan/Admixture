# Fishery genomics of Sebastes: from theory to applications 

## 1. Investigating population structure in the overall dataset as a first step 

Using ADMIXTURE, a program customed for SNP datasets only, we aimed to define the genetic units present in two fish species: *Sebastes faciatus* and *S. mentella*.
Those two species are curently fished in some regions of the Atlantic Canada while in othe regions the stocks are endangered. 
Using a wide dataset of SNPs markers may help us to better delineate the stock structure than with the use of microsatellites.

### a. Admixture analysis

We first run ADMIXTURE with the following parameters:
